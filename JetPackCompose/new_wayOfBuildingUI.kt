You're using Jetpack Compose, which is the newer way of building UIs in Android.
 Thatâ€™s why there is no activity_main.xml layout file â€” because Jetpack Compose doesnâ€™t use XML layouts at all!


ðŸ¤” Want to switch back to XML layouts?
If you want to use XML-based layouts (for learning or UI designer tool), hereâ€™s how:

Right-click res/layout â†’ New â†’ Layout Resource File.

Name it activity_main.xml.

Inside MainActivity.kt, replace the setContent {} block with:
setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
